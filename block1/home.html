<h3>Lose Weight</h3>
<p>  If an individual wants to lose weight he/she must follow a calorie stricted diet(This doesn't mean to starve but to eat less). 
Typically a person daily calorie intake must lie between<strong> 1500-1800 </strong> calories per day
coming from protein,carbohydrates and fats, carbohydates intake must be low and boiled vegetables should be included instead of this and healthy fats eg almonds,peanut butter can be increased and Water intake must be 5-6 litres per day
